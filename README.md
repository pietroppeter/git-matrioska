# git-matrioska

A normcore git workflow to maintain a production (ML) repo.

Only exists as a quickly whipped up set of slides: https://pietroppeter.github.io/git-matrioska/

This was my first lightning talk. At my first event where this kind of things happen.
It happened at PyData Amsterdam 2023. It was... interesting.

The idea (git-matrioska) is probably a bad idea or it just applies to a very small use case and
I cannot really put my finger on why it is weird.
But I did use this in my small team for some time and it seemed to actually work well.

An even worse idea was, on the morning of the first day of the event, to decide to give a lightning talk about this possibly bad idea
with the idea that, well, so people will tell me why it is bad and I will have learnt about it.

Only I had very little time to prepare the slides (thanks nimislides to the rescue I did prepare them while _not really_ following the talks!),
and at the end of the day with my brain almost fried by all the great content I had seen and my energies depleted by enjoying talking with a lot of great people.

So I walked on stage in front of a few hundreds people (attendes were reported at 800 but hopefully not all were there),
I mumble an excuse for my poor state and manage to have to rush the final slides (where I actually talk about the solution)
because I did not have time anymore (hey, I timed it at 3mins when I rehearsed it...).

It did seem to provide some kind of entertainment (if not technical content) and an additional chance for talking to people, which were very kind to me afterwards (my guess is they were thinking something along the lines of "_this poor lad, he clearly is confused but he does not seem a bad person, so let's just smile at him and let's hope he does not try to start a conversation!_").

All in all, although being very stressful, I will probably do it again (mmh... maybe).

At some point I might improve on the slides and give a better (and longer) presentation.
